Abstract:

This study introduces four heterogeneous ensemble-learning techniques, including stacking, blending, simple averaging and weighted averaging, to predict landslide susceptibility in Yanshan County, China. These techniques combine several state-of-the-art classifiers of convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, support vector machine and logistic regression in specific ways to produce reliable results and avoid issues with model selections. The study consists of three main steps. The first step establishes a spatial database consisting of 16 landslide conditioning factors and 380 landslide historical locations. The second step randomly selects training (70% of the total) and test (30%) datasets out of grid cells corresponding to landslide and non-slide locations in the study area. The final step constructs the proposed heterogeneous ensemble methods for landslide susceptibility mapping. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble methods obtained higher prediction accuracy than the individual classifiers mentioned above based on statistical measures. In particular, the blending ensemble method achieves the highest overall accuracy of 80.70% among the other ensemble methods.
